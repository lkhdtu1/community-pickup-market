# üß™ MANUAL TESTING GUIDE - Producer ID Fix Verification

## ‚ö° Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Start Servers** 
Open two PowerShell terminals:

**Terminal 1 (Frontend):**
```powershell
cd d:\git\community-pickup-market
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Backend):**
```powershell
cd d:\git\community-pickup-market\server
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Open Application**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001/api

## üéØ CRITICAL TEST: Order Creation with Multiple Producers

This test verifies the main bug fix - orders should now work correctly with multiple producers.

### **Step-by-Step Test:**

#### **Step 1: Add Products from Different Producers** 
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Browse products and look for items from different producers
3. Add at least 2 products from **different producers** to your cart
4. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Cart shows products with different producer names

#### **Step 2: Test Cart Producer Tracking**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab  
2. In the application, go to your cart
3. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Each cart item should have a `producerId` field (not hardcoded '1')

#### **Step 3: Proceed to Checkout**
1. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
2. Fill in customer information if needed
3. ‚úÖ **Verify**: No errors, checkout form appears

#### **Step 4: Select Pickup Point (CRITICAL)**
1. Select a pickup point from the dropdown
2. Click "Confirm Order"
3. ‚úÖ **VERIFY**: Order confirmation appears (previously this failed!)
4. ‚úÖ **VERIFY**: No error messages about incomplete orders

#### **Step 5: Check Database (Optional)**
If you have database access:
```sql
-- Check recent orders
SELECT 
    id, 
    "producerId", 
    status, 
    total,
    "createdAt"
FROM orders 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check cart items with producer IDs
SELECT 
    id,
    "productName",
    "producerId",
    producer
FROM cart_items 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## üîß TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

### **Code Changes to Verify:**

#### **1. CartItem Interface Update**
Check these files have `producerId: string` field:
- `/src/types/product.ts` 
- `/src/utils/cartUtils.ts`

#### **2. Product Pages Fixed**
Check these files include producer ID when adding to cart:
- `/src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx` ‚Üí `producerId: product.producer?.id`
- `/src/pages/ProductsPage.tsx` ‚Üí `producerId: product.producer.id`

#### **3. Order Creation Fixed**
Check `/src/pages/Index.tsx`:
- ‚ùå **OLD**: `const producerId = '1';` (hardcoded)
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: `const producerId = item.producerId;` (dynamic)

#### **4. Database Schema**
Check cart_items table has new column:
```sql
\d cart_items
-- Should show: producerId | character varying | YES
```

## üö® EXPECTED BEHAVIORS

### **BEFORE Fix (Broken):**
- ‚ùå Orders would fail after selecting pickup point
- ‚ùå All orders would be assigned to producer ID "1" 
- ‚ùå "Order incomplete" errors
- ‚ùå Cart items had no producer tracking

### **AFTER Fix (Working):**
- ‚úÖ Orders complete successfully after pickup point selection
- ‚úÖ Each order gets the correct producer ID from cart items
- ‚úÖ No "order incomplete" errors
- ‚úÖ Cart items properly track which producer they came from
- ‚úÖ Multiple orders created when cart contains items from different producers

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Frontend Won't Start:**
```powershell
cd d:\git\community-pickup-market
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **If Backend Won't Start:**
```powershell
cd d:\git\community-pickup-market\server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **If Database Errors:**
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. Check connection settings in `.env`
3. Run migration: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d community_market -f add-producer-id-to-cart-items.sql`

### **If Orders Still Fail:**
1. Clear browser localStorage: DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Clear All
2. Restart both servers
3. Try with fresh cart items

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**The fix is working correctly if:**

1. ‚úÖ You can add products from multiple producers to cart
2. ‚úÖ Cart items show different producer names  
3. ‚úÖ Checkout process completes without errors
4. ‚úÖ Pickup point selection works
5. ‚úÖ Order confirmation appears after clicking "Confirm Order"
6. ‚úÖ No console errors related to producer ID
7. ‚úÖ Database shows orders with correct producer IDs (not all "1")

---

## üéâ COMPLETION CONFIRMATION

Once you've successfully:
- ‚úÖ Added products from different producers to cart
- ‚úÖ Selected a pickup point  
- ‚úÖ Confirmed an order successfully
- ‚úÖ Received order confirmation

**The critical "order incomplete issue after choosing pickup point" is officially resolved!** üéâ

*This test verifies the main producer ID fix that resolves the order creation failure.*
